# Coding-Exercise

## Description

Technical exercise proposed by Knack, which involves obtaining duplicate objects and fields
from a mock file and creating a new file with those duplicates removed.

## Use

- npm install
- npm run start

## File directory

- data/ - Data to clean
- logs/ - Generated data file that contains information about usage
- test/ - Test suite for code issues
- src/ - Main folder that contains the application source code.
  - src/main.js - Entry point of the application.
  - src/utils/ - Folder that contains utility functions and helper modules.

## Possible improvements:

Understanding the mock data, creating the tests, and the code development have taken me two hours and fifteen minutes.
As a result, I haven't been able to complete the tests as I would have liked, and there are two test cases left to implement,
which would be:

- Test with empty objects or fields.
- Test with malformed input data, do it on TypeScript could solve this problem.
